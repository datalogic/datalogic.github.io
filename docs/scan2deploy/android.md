`Scan2Deploy` is an application devoted to the initial staging of Android devices by reading a barcode sequence. Depending on the content of the staging barcodes `Scan2Deploy` will, in this order:

* configure the device Wi-Fi network,
* control some device inner system settings (e.g. the lock-screen enabled state),
* download a data archive from a HTTP/HTTPS server and unpack it to the device,
* install/update applications and the system image, and
* run a customary script (to perform any additional setup).

It's worth noticing that the application is *not* a resident service. The above-mentioned actions are performed as long as `Scan2Deploy` is active and in use.

## Downloads

Downloads are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android/releases) section on the Scan2Deploy Android Github page.

## Enable Scan2Deploy

Scan2Deploy acts as an Android Enterprise [Device Policy Cotroller (DPC)](https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/build-dpc), running in [device owner mode](https://developers.google.com/android/work/play/emm-api/prov-devices#modes_of_operation). This allows Scan2Deploy to configure many protected device settings that would otherwise not be possible. Any DPC app that acts as a device owner must be configured to do so during device setup. By scanning a QR code at the first page of the Android Setup Wizard ("Hi There! page) on a new or factory-reset device, Scan2Deploy is configured as device owner. There are 2 types of QR codes that are supported:

* [Android Enterprise provisiong QR code](#Android-Enterprise-provisioning-QR-code)
* [Scan2Deploy QR Code](#creating-scan2deploy-files)

### Android Enterprise provisioning QR code

Scan the following QR code at the `Hi There!` page to enroll `Scan2Deploy` as device owner:

![Latest Version](/img/scan2deploy_android/scan2deploy-default.gif)

**Note:** When [generating Scan2Deploy QR codes](#barcode-generation), add `"enroll": true` in your `"layout"` section to cause this same QR code to be displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the page created.

```json
    "layout": {
        "enroll": true
    },

```

#### Install a new version of Scan2Deploy

Scan2Deploy is pre-installed on Datalogic Android devices, however, if you want to use an updated version instead, you can create a custom Android Enterprise enrollment barcode that pulls a new version from Github (or another location of your choosing). The list of valid fields you can choose from are [documented here](https://developers.google.com/android/work/play/emm-api/prov-devices#create_a_qr_code).  A sample configuration and pre-generated barcode are provided below.

There are several tools you can use to encode your JSON data into a QR code. A few options are provided below.

* [qrencode](https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en) - Linux command line utility. Example usage: `qrencode -o s2dupdate.png < s2dupdate.json`
* [QR Code Generator](https://kazuhikoarase.github.io/qrcode-generator/js/demo/) - online tool suitable for copy-paste of JSON data.

##### Version 1.11

The JSON and associated barcode for version `1.11` are provided below:

```json
{
    "android.app.extra.PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_COMPONENT_NAME": "com.datalogic.scan2deploy/com.datalogic.scan2deploy.DeviceOwnerReceiver",
    "android.app.extra.PROVISIONING_LEAVE_ALL_SYSTEM_APPS_ENABLED": true,
    "android.app.extra.PROVISIONING_SKIP_ENCRYPTION": true,
    "android.app.extra.PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM": "6CG8ls-pzlKcJNeoZtAC-neobD_ypZCI853n_TBGEHI=",
"android.app.extra.PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_PACKAGE_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION": "https://github.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android/releases/download/v1.11/Scan2Deploy.apk"
}
```

## Creating Scan2Deploy files

You will need to create your Scan2Deploy JSON files using a text editor. A JSON schemas is available to help ensure valid file content. There are several advantages to using an editor that supports this schema:

* Provides help text for each field
* Provides real-time compiler-like messages letting you know when you have made a mistake
* Allows you to write files faster and with fewer mistakes

### $schema

A [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) file is used to define the structure and features available in Scan2Deploy. The `$schema` tag is used to indicate which version of the schema you are using. You can versions of schema along with complete field documentation at the [Scan2Deploy Android schema](https://github.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android-schema) repo.

<br>

ðŸ”— [schema reference](https://github.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android-schema)

<br>

The latest schema can be referenced like this:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android-schema/master/schema.json"
}
```

You can also point to a specific version of the schema by pointing to the desired tag. For example:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android-schema/v1-1-0/schema.json"
}
```

### Choosing an editor

There are several good JSON editors available. We reccommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is free and has [many features designed to make writing JSON files easier](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json), including utilizing JSON schemas.

By including the aforementioned `$schema` tag in you JSON file, Visual Studio Code will provide automatic tool tips and error underlining:

Some other editors know to use the schema files on schemastore.org when a given file uses a specific file extension that is registered on schemastore.org:  `file-name.dla.json`

### Barcode Generation

Scan2Deploy barcodes are generated with the `Scan2Deploy` UI inside DXU Desktop. From the main *Device Configuration Utility* page, click the *Scan2Deploy (Beta)* button:

![Scan2Deploy button](/img/scan2deploy_android/image81.png)

Once you are at the Scan2Deploy UI page, you can browse to the JSON file you have created and then click `Generate PDF`.

![Scan2Deploy button](/img/scan2deploy_android/image82.png)

A PDF page will open up in your default PDF viewer, ready for you to print, save, or scan.

## Third-party Integration

The application can be either controller by the user, or programmatically controlled in un-manned manner. This can be achieved by calling the launch intent for the `com.datalogic.android.scan2deploy` package and passing the encoded data representing the configuration to be applied.

```java
Context context = ...; // Android context to be used (e.g. the current activity one)
String data = ...; // Encoded Scan2Deploy configuration
PackageManager packageManager = context.getPackageManager();
Intent launchIntent = packageManager.getLaunchIntentForPackage("com.datalogic.android.scan2deploy");
launchIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
launchIntent.putExtra("data", data);
context.startActivity(launchIntent);
```

To obtain the encoded configuration data, the `dl_config.exe` program need to be called with the `--encodeonly=true` flag. In this case, obviously, the output filename is not required. An example output in this case is the following:

```console
> dl_config.exe lock-test.json --encodeonly=true
Datalogic Staging Configurator (ver 1.6.0)

-----END ENCODED DATA-----
```

The data string to be passed is the ASCII armored sequence (header and trailer included).

As a sidenote, when launched from intent it could be beneficial to specify the global action for the application in order to (for example) automatically close it when the settings have been applied.
