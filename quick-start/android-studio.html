<h2>Install Android Studio</h2>

{% include info-box.html msg='Please notice that the following instructions are valid for Android Studio versions released on the <em><strong>stable</strong></em> channel, there is no support for the <em>beta</em> channel' %}

Download Android Studio from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">official website</a>
and follow the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio">installation instructions</a>. After installing Android Studio, install the Android SDK through the Android SDK Manager or provide a correct path to one already installed. Since developers are encouraged to target the most recent and updated Android SDK release while developing an application, choose the most new API level released and download the associated platform.

{% highlight none %}
{{ site.addonxml_url }}
{% endhighlight %}
</br>
{% include img.html src='install-sdk-as-site-url.png' %}

<p>Now select the tab <em><strong>SDK Platforms</strong></em> in the Android SDK settings panel and check the checkbox on the

{% include img.html src='install-sdk-as-checkbox.png' %}

<p>Under each displayed section, corresponding to the Android releases available, <b>Datalogic SDK v1</b> Add-on should appear. Choose and install the development kit in accordance with your Android platform of choice.<br/>
To install it, check Datalogic SDK v1 checkbox and a small icon on the left should appear.</p>
{% include info-box.html level='warn' msg='Please notice that you must also install the Android API platform matching the Android version in use for development in your environment (i.e. API 23 is required to compile apps supported up to Android 6.0).

{% include img.html src='install-sdk-as-before-install.png' %}

<p>Click on the button <em><strong>Apply</strong></em> to install the selected packages and confirm the choice in the next dialog.</p>

{% include img.html src='install-sdk-as-selected-confirm-eula-installed.png' %}

<p>Once the installation is complete, the <em>Status</em> of the Datalogic SDK v1 Add-on changes from

<h2>Use Datalogic SDK</h2>
When it comes to develop new applications and take advantage of Datalogic devices, simply follow these guided steps.
</div>

<div id="create-apps" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Create new applications</h3>
<p>When creating a new project choose <em><strong>Start a new Android Studio project</strong></em> from the Android Studio Welcome screen.</p>
{% include img.html src='start-as-new-project.png' %}

{% include info-box.html level='warn' msg='Please notice that you must select the <em>Minimum SDK</em> level in accordance with the installed Android firmware version on your Datalogic device. For example, a device running Android Jelly Bean, can support applications built with Minimum SDK level selected up to 16. Greater values will produce an incompatible Android app'%}
<p>When creating a new project choose the most correct Minimum SDK API level and press <em><strong>Next</strong></em>.</p>
{% include img.html src='start-as-new-project-wizard-minimum-sdk.png' %}

<p>The wizard will guide through the creation of a new application.</p>

<p>With a choice of basic layout and Activity styles.</p>
{% include img.html src='start-as-new-project-activity.png' %}

<p>Complete the guided wizard and let the IDE settle down. A generic Android application, runnable on all Android devices, is now ready for development.</p>
</div>

<div id="compile-projects" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Compile projects</h3>
With the previous steps, you have simply prepared a basic environment for a generic Android application. Through the next steps, instead, your basic application will leverage on custom Datalogic SDK functionalities and will be compiled to be compatible with a Datalogic device.

<p>In order to gain access to the SDK functionalities, applications need to be compiled with the right Datalogic SDK environment.
To do so, right click on <em>app</em> folder under the Android project module, then select <em><strong>Open Module Settings</strong></em>.</p>
{% include img.html src='start-as-right-compile.png' %}

<p>In the following window point to <em>Project Structure</em> &gt; <em>Modules app</em> tab <em>Properties</em> and change the <em><strong>Compile Sdk Version</strong></em> accordingly, matching the right Datalogic SDK with the API level in use. In the showed example we are compiling apps with the latest Android 6.0 API level, meaning we need to select a corresponding Datalogic SDK matching the same level (rember to download and install the matching Datalogic Add-on). Confirm the choice by pressing <em><strong>OK</strong></em>.</p>
{% include info-box.html msg='The following step is mandatory in order to prepare the enviroment correctly' %}
{% include img.html src='start-as-right-compile-with-sdk.png' %}

<p>Android Studio will now switch to the Datalogic SDK v1, allowing you to develop and extend your app to the Datalogic Android APIs. Take a look at the <a href="https://datalogic.github.io/android-sdk-docs">API reference</a> and available <a href="../tutorials">examples</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="gradle" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Gradle scripts</h3>
Compiling an application with the Datalogic SDK it is a matter of matching and using the most correct configuration of the <em>build.gradle</em> file associated to the application.

<p>In the following example we are matching the <em>targetSdkVersion</em> with a corresponding level of Datalogic SDK Add-on (the trailing number is exactly <em>23</em>):</p>
{% highlight groovy %}
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 'Datalogic:Datalogic SDK v1:23'
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.3"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.generic.myapplication"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 23
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you are pointing to a different target version, install the matching Datalogic SDK v1 Add-on through the Android SDK Manager.</p>
</div>

<div id="android-manifest" class="section scrollspy">
<h3>Android application manifest</h3>
Android applications must have generally an <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html"><em>App Manifest</em> (AndroidManifest.xml)</a>,
 where all information about the application itself are exposed. Datalogic device compatible apps, relying on Datalogic SDK, 
 require a mandatory change to the Android application manifest in order to work. 
 It is strictly necessary the right usage of <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-library-element.html"><em>&lt;uses-library&gt;</em></a> tag, 
 to protect the developed applications against misuse and installation on incompatible devices. 
 In addition the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-library-element.html"><em>&lt;uses-library&gt;</em></a> 
 links your application against the Datalogic SDK or possible Datalogic SDK Extension whenever is launched.<br/>
{% include info-box.html level='warn' msg='Please notice that this step is <em><strong>mandatory</strong></em> to make your application fully compatible 
with the Datalogic SDK installed on the device. Do not forget to include all the libraries that you rely on or use, inside the AndroidManifest.xml.' %}
<p>
The inclusion of the following tag (within the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html"><em>&lt;application&gt;</em></a> element) 
in <strong>all</strong> Android applications built with the Datalogic SDK is necessary:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:theme="@android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault" >

    <uses-library
        android:name="com.datalogic.device"
        android:required="true" />

</application>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
While, in case of use of a further Datalogic SDK Extension, the following change is mandatory (e.g. Selfshopping Extension):
</p>
{% highlight xml %}

    <uses-library
        android:name="com.datalogic.extension.selfshopping"
        android:required="true" />

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Pay attention while changing the required libraries inside your application's AndroidManifest. 
    If you strictly rely on certain extension, do not forget to emphasize it with <strong><em>android:required</em></strong> tag. 
    Thanks to it, you will protect your application from installation on incompatible devices.</p>

    <h3>Sample app</h3>
We have provided one sample app setup in the way described in this tutorial: <a href="{{ site.samples_url.astudio }}/Kotlin/DecodeListenerAlt">DecodeListenerAlt</a>.
However, we do encourage you to use the <a href="/quick-start/jitpack-maven.html">Maven dependency method</a> which the majority
of sample apps implement preferentially.
