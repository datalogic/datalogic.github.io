        <h5>How to use</h5>

        To include the Datalogic Android SDK in your project (using Maven):

        Add a gradle dependency for the SDK, which is available through the JitPack.io Maven repository.
        This option is described below.

        <h5>Add jitpack.io repository</h5>

        Add a reference to jitpack.io to the <code class="code-grey-small">build.gradle</code> file at your project's base/root directory:

        <pre><code class="code-grey" >
        allprojects {
         repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
         }
        }
    </code>
</pre>

        <h5>Add a dependency on the SDK</h5>

        Add a reference to the specific version of the SDK you would like to use to your <code class="code-grey-small">app/build.gradle</code> file. In
        this example, we are using version <code class="code-grey-small">1.12</code>. You can see a list of all released versions
        <a href="https://github.com/datalogic/datalogic-android-sdk/releases">here</a>.

        <pre>
            <code class="code-grey">
        dependencies {
            implementation 'com.github.datalogic:datalogic-android-sdk:1.12'
        }
            </code>
    </pre>
    </div>
