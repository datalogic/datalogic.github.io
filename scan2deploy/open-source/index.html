HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================<br><br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a href="http://www.cwi.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.cwi.nl</a>) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#x27;s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br><br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us</a>) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.<br><br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br><br>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.opensource.org</a> for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.<br><br>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-                     from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don&#x27;t.<br><br>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to     CNRI, however, Stallman&#x27;s lawyer has told CNRI&#x27;s lawyer that 1.6.1     is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.<br><br>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#x27;s direction to make these releases possible.<br><br> B.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights<br> under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.<br> <br> <br> Section 2 -- Scope.<br> <br> a. License grant.<br> <br> 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br> the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br> non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br> exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br> <br> a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br> in part; and<br> <br> b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.<br> <br> 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br> Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br> License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br> its terms and conditions.<br> <br> 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br> 6(a).<br> <br> 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The<br> Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br> all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br> and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br> Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br> authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br> necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br> technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br> Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br> simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br> (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br> <br> 5. Downstream recipients.<br> <br> a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br> recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br> receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br> Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br> Public License.<br> <br> b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br> any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br> apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br> Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br> Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br> Material.<br> <br> 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br> may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br> are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br> with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br> the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br> provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br> <br> b. Other rights.<br> <br> 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br> licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br> privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br> the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br> assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br> extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br> Rights, but not otherwise.<br> <br> 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br> Public License.<br> <br> 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br> collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br> Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br> under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br> licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br> reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br> <br> <br> Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br> <br> Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br> following conditions.<br> <br> a. Attribution.<br> <br> 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br> form), You must:<br> <br> a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br> with the Licensed Material:<br> <br> i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br> Material and any others designated to receive<br> attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br> the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br> designated);<br> <br> ii. a copyright notice;<br> <br> iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br> <br> iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br> warranties;<br> <br> v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br> extent reasonably practicable;<br> <br> b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br> retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br> <br> c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br> Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br> hyperlink to, this Public License.<br> <br> 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br> reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br> which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br> reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br> hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br> information.<br> <br> 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br> information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br> reasonably practicable.<br> <br> 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#x27;s<br> License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted<br> Material from complying with this Public License.<br> <br> <br> Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br> <br> Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br> apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br> <br> a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br> to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br> portion of the contents of the database;<br> <br> b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br> contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br> Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br> Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br> <br> c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br> all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br> <br> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br> replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br> Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br> <br> <br> Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br> <br> a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br> EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br> AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br> ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br> IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br> WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br> PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br> ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br> KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br> ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br> <br> b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br> TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br> NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br> INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br> COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br> USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br> ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br> DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br> IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br> <br> c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br> above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br> possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br> waiver of all liability.<br> <br> <br> Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br> <br> a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br> Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br> this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br> terminate automatically.<br> <br> b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br> Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br> <br> 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br> it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br> violation; or<br> <br> 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br> <br> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br> right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br> of this Public License.<br> <br> c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br> Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br> distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br> will not terminate this Public License.<br> <br> d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br> License.<br> <br> <br> Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br> <br> a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br> terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br> <br> b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br> Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br> independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br> <br> <br> Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br> <br> a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br> shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br> conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br> be made without permission under this Public License.<br> <br> b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br> deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br> minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br> cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br> without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br> conditions.<br> <br> c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br> failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br> Licensor.<br> <br> d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br> as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br> that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br> processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</td></tr><tr><td>canvg</td><td>3.0.10</td><td>MIT</td><td>Copyright (c) 2010 - present Gabe Lerner (<a href="mailto:gabelerner@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gabelerner@gmail.com</a>) - <a href="https://github.com/canvg/canvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/canvg/canvg</a><br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
