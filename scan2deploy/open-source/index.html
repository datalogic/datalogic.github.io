HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================<br><br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a href="http://www.cwi.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.cwi.nl</a>) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#x27;s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br><br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us</a>) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.<br><br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br><br>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.opensource.org</a> for the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.<br><br>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-                     from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don&#x27;t.<br><br>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to     CNRI, however, Stallman&#x27;s lawyer has told CNRI&#x27;s lawyer that 1.6.1     is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.<br><br>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&#x27;s direction to make these releases possible.<br><br> B.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</td></tr><tr><td>form-data</td><td>2.3.3</td><td>MIT</td><td>Copyright (c) 2012 Felix GeisendÃ¶rfer (<a href="mailto:felix@debuggable.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">felix@debuggable.com</a>) and contributors<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</td></tr><tr><td>safe-buffer</td><td>5.1.2</td><td>MIT</td><td>Copyright (c) Feross Aboukhadijeh<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
