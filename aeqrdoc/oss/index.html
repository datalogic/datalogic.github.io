Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar<br> Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material<br> and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,<br> arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring<br> permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the<br> Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed<br> Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,<br> Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is<br> synched in timed relation with a moving image.<br> <br> b. Adapter&#x27;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright<br> and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in<br> accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br> <br> c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights<br> closely related to copyright including, without limitation,<br> performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database<br> Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or<br> categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights<br> specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar<br> Rights.<br> <br> d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the<br> absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws<br> fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright<br> Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international<br> agreements.<br> <br> e.

The<br> Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br> all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br> and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br> Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br> authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br> necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br> technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br> Technological Measures.

Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br> recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br> receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br> Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br> Public License.<br> <br> b.

To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br> collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br> Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br> under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br> licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br> reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br> <br> <br> Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br> <br> Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br> following conditions.<br> <br> a. Attribution.<br> <br> 1.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br> reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br> which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br> reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br> hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br> information.<br> <br> 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br> information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br> reasonably practicable.<br> <br> 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#x27;s<br> License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted<br> Material from complying with this Public License.<br> <br> <br> Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br> <br> Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br> apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br> <br> a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br> to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br> portion of the contents of the database;<br> <br> b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br> contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br> Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br> Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br> <br> c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br> all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br> <br> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br> replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br> Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br> <br> <br> Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br> <br> a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br> EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br> AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br> ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br> IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br> WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br> PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br> ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br> KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br> ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br> <br> b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br> TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br> NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br> INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br> COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br> USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br> ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br> DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br> IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br> <br> c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br> above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br> possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br> waiver of all liability.<br> <br> <br> Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br> <br> a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br> Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br> this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br> terminate automatically.<br> <br> b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br> Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br> <br> 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br> it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br> violation; or<br> <br> 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br> <br> For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br> right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br> of this Public License.<br> <br> c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br> Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br> distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br> will not terminate this Public License.<br> <br> d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br> License.<br> <br> <br> Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br> <br> a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br> terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br> <br> b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br> Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br> independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br> <br> <br> Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br> <br> a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br> shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br> conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br> be made without permission under this Public License.<br> <br> b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br> deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br> minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br> cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br> without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br> conditions.<br> <br> c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br> failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br> Licensor.<br> <br> d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br> as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br> that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br> processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</td></tr><tr><td>canvg</td><td>3.0.10</td><td>MIT</td><td>Copyright (c) 2010 - present Gabe Lerner (<a href="mailto:gabelerner@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gabelerner@gmail.com</a>) - <a href="https://github.com/canvg/canvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/canvg/canvg</a><br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
