If one is, you will receive a notification. You can choose to do the update immediately or to be notified again the next time Scan2Deploy Studio is launched. \\n  * You have the option of chosing between the `Stable` (Default) channel and `Beta` channel for updates. Choose the `Beta` channel if you want access to the latest features and are willing to deal with possible bugs. \\n  * If you choose the `Beta` channel and then decide you want to switch back to the `Stable` channel, simply switch the setting back to `Stable` and then click the `Check for update` button in the task tray.\\n  * See the [task tray](/scan2deploy/studio/#task-tray) documentation for more detail.\\n\\n### Auto-save profiles while editing\\n  * If you exit Scan2Deploy Studio while in the middle of editing, and then re-enter, you will be taken directly to the last page you were editiing.\\n  * If you click the **Scan2Deploy Studio** (home) button in the upper left hand corner of the screen, you will be presented with a pop-up window titled **Unsaved profile**.

This requires Scan2Deploy Agent v1.33 or above on the device to work.\\n  * [More details](/scan2deploy/save-and-print-page#scan2deploy-qr-code-version)\\n\\n### SFTP profile download locations\\n\\n* The SFTP protocol is now supported when you are hosting a profile externally. See [here](/scan2deploy/save-and-print-page#external-hosting) for more details.\\n\\n### Visual keyboard remapper file support\\n\\n* If you add a Visual Keyboard Remapper file **(.zip)** on the ***Save and Print*** page, you will be presented with more options related to the file, you will be provided options as to if and how it should be applied on the device.\\n* The Visual Keyboard Remapper software is currently only available internally at Datalogic. It can be used to visually remap keys for different functions. It is most useful on devices with full keyboard, like the **Skorpio X5**.\\n* See [here] for more details.\\n\\n### Miscellaneous\\n\\n* Combined the ***Scanner Settings*** and ***Device Settings*** pages.  The new combined [Scanner and Device Settings page](/scan2deploy/scanner-and-device-page) provides all the settings of the previous two pages in one. \\n* This page receives periodic updates directly, every 2 to 3 months, without having to update your version of Scan2Deploy Studio.\\n* Improved \\"Scan the barcode\\" message on the ***Save and Print*** page.\\n\\n## Compatibility\\n\\n[Scan2Deploy Agent 1.35](https://github.com/datalogic/scan2deploy-android/releases/) is required for some new features added to this version of Scan2Deploy Studio.
