The **Auto Scan Trigger** system has been extended with a new **CUSTOM_RANGE** option, offering greater control over scan sensitivity, while cradle functionality now supports **SoHo cradles** with updated properties and thermal protection handling.\\n\\nTo further improve power management, the SDK adds a **PowerStatus notification system** and refines the **Enterprise Battery Saver**, now supporting rate control in bps. Several new display management options have also been introduced, including **brightness range limits**, **facedown detection**.\\n\\nFor users leveraging **Desktop Mode**, new properties now allow control over the visibility of hotseat in dual screen mode.\\n\\nFinally, for security, the new **APP_INFO_HIDDEN** property restricts access to system settings via the App Info shortcut, while the **EXTRA_SYSTEM_FIRMWARE_UPGRADE_WIPE_ESIM_PROFILES** flag enables secure eSIM profile handling during system upgrades. Additional enhancements include Item Tracking APIs, **SOS button** support, new OCR format options (**TD2**, **MRVA**, **MRVB**).\\n\\nYou can access the [documentation here](/android/overview).\\n\\n## Enhancements\\n\\n* Updated DLScreensaver package name to `com.datalogic.settings.datalogicscreensaver`.\\n* Added a documentation warning for preventing installation of a new formatter project from client app\'s storage.\\n* Added `CAMERA_WEDGE_ENABLE_ALWAYS_ON` to manage the availability of scan mode to always on when the camera wedge is active.\\n* Added `CameraWedgePreviewManager` class for setting up a preview that will be shown when the camera wedge feature is running (only when no barcode is shown).\\n* Added new option `CUSTOM_RANGE` in `AutoScanTriggerRange` and properties for configuring a custom range for the autoscan feature.\\n* Added SoHo-supported cradle\'s properties and classes.\\n* Removed unsupported methods `getDontKeepActivities()`, `getBackgroundProcessLimit()`, and `getDisableGoldCluster()`.\\n* Updated download rate limitation to **bps** in `EnterpriseBatterySaver`.\\n* Added Item Tracking APIs.\\n* Added battery LED documentation for smart charging and battery issue behavior.\\n* Updated relevant APIs to reference the commercial name of Joya Smart instead of project name SoHo.\\n* Updated cradle property: `CUSTOM_AREA` -> `CUSTOM_AREA_BASE`.\\n* Removed `enableLedOnLockUnlock()` method from DLCradleManager class.\\n* CradleManager shall reject de-registering a listener if the device doesn\'t support the feature that triggers that event.\\n* Added a new intent extra `EXTRA_SYSTEM_FIRMWARE_UPGRADE_WIPE_ESIM_PROFILES` to system upgrade intent to wipe the eSIM profiles.\\n* Added the possibility to scale the preview when installing it.\\n* Added hotseat visibility control in dual screen mode.\\n* Added new `APP_INFO_HIDDEN` property to restrict the user from accessing Settings application from App Info shortcut.\\n* Added PowerStatus notification system to notify the user about the current power status of the device.\\n* Added intent extra `EXTRA_CRADLE_FAILURE_THERMAL_PROTECTION_POGO` for thermal protection failure on pogo pins.\\n* Added intents `ACTION_TROLLEY_DEVICE_CORRECTLY_INSERTED` and `ACTION_TROLLEY_DEVICE_EXTRACTED` to detect trolley insertion/extraction.\\n* Added SOS button feature support.\\n* Added 3 new OCR format options:\\n  * `OCR_TD2_ENABLE`\\n  * `OCR_MRVA_ENABLE`\\n  * `OCR_MRVB_ENABLE`\\n* Added new properties `SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_RANGE_MIN` and `SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_RANGE_MAX` to support backlight range limit configuration.\\n* Added new property `SCREEN_FACEDOWN_DETECTOR_ENABLE` to support facedown detector configuration."},{"id":"/2025/09/19/oemconfig","metadata":{"permalink":"/releases/2025/09/19/oemconfig","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-19-oemconfig.md","title":"OEMConfig
